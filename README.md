  Emporia State University

### Selected Projects

#### Business & Market Analytics
**Video Game Market Trends Analysis** (Collaborative Capstone Project)  
Collaborated with a teammate on global video game sales data analysis to inform product launch strategy. Led **SQL** querying, data cleaning, and exploratory analysis to evaluate revenue trends, genre profitability, regional performance, and correlations between ratings and sales.  
**Key Insight**: Action genre drove the highest global revenue (especially in North America and Europe).  
**Recommendation**: Prioritize an action-based game targeting North America for maximum profitability.

#### Healthcare & Risk Analytics
**Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Predictors**  
Built and compared predictive models on public healthcare datasets to identify key risk factors for Alzheimer's, emphasizing accuracy and operational simplicity. Evaluated **logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, random forests, and Bayesian networks**.  
**Top Performer**: Bayesian Network-based GLM using just **three variables** (age, family history, APOE genotype) for strong predictive power.  
**Impact**: Enables scalable, low-burden early risk screening programs.

#### Research & Advanced Methods
**Robust Low-Rank Tensor Discriminant Analysis** (Graduate Research)  
Developed a novel classification framework for high-dimensional tensor data (e.g., medical imaging). Extended optimal scoring discriminant analysis with **low-rank Tucker decomposition, elastic-net regularization, and robust loss functions** to improve noise resistance and computational efficiency.  
Validated on synthetic data and large-scale MRI datasets (OASIS, ADNI).  
**Results**: Enhanced stability, interpretability, and performance in disease classification tasks compared to traditional methods.
